# Module-01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The following site was made and deployed following the instruction of my bootcamp module-1 challenge. The primary focus of the challenge was the refactoring and labeling of code already supplied to me, and then allow the code to flourish on a deployed site platform.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.

## Deployment

## Notable Changes

1. Site now employs normalize.css. Was not mandatory.
2. Added a webpage name for the browser tab. Accessibility change.
3. Site links now work properly. Accessibility change.
4. "hero" div class was renamed to "title-image". Clarity change.
5. "title-image" img reference was moved from CSS to HTML to allow for alt. Accessibility change.
6. "search-engine-optimization" img heights were moved to the HTML because the length of the CSS file was bugging me. Not mandatory.
7. HTML has been tidied up to make it less painful on my poor little human eyeballs. Clarity change.
8. Full "alt" text descriptions have been written for accessibility reasons, especially with screen readers in mind. Accessibility change.
9. CSS has been reorganized and commented to make it more readable. Was part of the assignment, but I woulda done it anyway because I couldn't help myself. Clarity change.
10. Full ReadMe has been iterated. It me, I'm the ReadMe. Hello. I hope you enjoyed reading my contents.
